TODO:

Write tests for new dancers

push dancers to window.dancers array

Line up button (lineup method)

Make dancers that interact with other dancers. For example, by iterating across the array window.dancers and using the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate your distance from each other dancer, you can have a dancer find its n closest neighbors and do something based on their positions.

Make a dancer react to the mouse

Make the page look cool, post to slack

Go back and add at least two additional unit tests. If possible, try to add tests that will require you improve your implementation in order to make them pass.
